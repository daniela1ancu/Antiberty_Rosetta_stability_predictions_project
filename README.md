# Antiberty_Rosetta_stability_predictions_project

Introduction:
Accurate prediction of the impact of protein mutations on stability is a crucial challenge in computational structural biology, with applications in protein engineering, drug design, and understanding disease-associated variants. This project aims to compare the performance of two widely used computational tools, Rosetta and AntiBERTy, in predicting the effects of point mutations on antibody stability.

Objectives:
1. Evaluate Rosetta and AntiBERTy's accuracy and biases in predicting the impact of point mutations on antibody stability.
2. Investigate the potential sources of bias in each tool, such as the composition of the training data, structure quality and solvent accessibility.
3. Explore strategies to improve these tools' predictive capabilities by integrating sequence and structure-based features.
